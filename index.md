Wallpaper Generator Studio

Last updated: January 2026

1. Introduction

Wallpaper Generator Studio respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Wallpaper Generator Studio mobile application.

Wallpaper Generator Studio does not require account creation and does not collect personal identification information such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.

2. User-Generated Content

Wallpaper Generator Studio allows users to generate custom wallpapers by entering text prompts and selecting styles or categories.

Text prompts and selected options are sent to a third-party AI service only to generate images requested by the user.
Prompts are not linked to any personal identity.

Wallpaper Generator Studio does not store prompts or generated images on its own servers unless the user explicitly chooses to share a wallpaper to the Community section.

Generated wallpapers are stored locally on your device only, unless you choose to delete them.

3. Community Content

Wallpaper Generator Studio includes an optional Community feature that allows users to browse and discover wallpapers shared by other users.

If you choose to share a wallpaper to the Community:

The shared content may include the generated image and selected metadata such as category or style.

No personal information is attached to shared wallpapers.

Usernames, accounts, or profiles are not required or created.

Shared content is intended to be publicly viewable within the app.

Wallpaper Generator Studio does not associate Community content with any identifiable user and does not collect personal data through the Community feature.

4. Third-Party Services
OpenAI

Wallpaper Generator Studio uses OpenAI’s image generation API to create wallpapers based on user input.

Prompt data may be processed by OpenAI in accordance with their own Privacy Policy. Wallpaper Generator Studio does not control how OpenAI handles this data.

Advertising (Google AdMob)

Wallpaper Generator Studio displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob.

Ads may use device-related information for ad delivery, frequency control, and performance measurement.
Wallpaper Generator Studio does not access or store advertising identifiers directly.
Personalized ads depend on your system-level privacy and advertising settings.

5. Photos Access

Wallpaper Generator Studio requests access to your photo library only when you choose to save a generated wallpaper.

The app does not read, scan, or upload your photo library.
Images are saved only after explicit user action.

6. Tracking & App Tracking Transparency

Wallpaper Generator Studio does not track users across apps or websites owned by other companies.

If tracking permission is requested, it is used solely to comply with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requirements and advertising regulations.

7. Data Storage & Retention

All generated wallpapers, favorites, and preferences are stored locally on your device.

Community-shared wallpapers are stored only as long as they are made available within the Community section.

You may remove all stored data at any time by deleting wallpapers within the app or uninstalling Wallpaper Generator Studio.

8. Children’s Privacy

Wallpaper Generator Studio is not intended for children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
