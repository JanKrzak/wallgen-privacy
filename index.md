1. Introduction

Wallpaper Generator Studio respects your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Wallpaper Generator Studio mobile application.

Wallpaper Generator Studio does not require account creation and does not collect personal identification information, such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.

2. User-Generated Content

Wallpaper Generator Studio allows users to generate custom wallpapers by entering text prompts and selecting styles or categories.

Text prompts and selected options are sent to a third-party AI service only to generate images requested by the user.

Prompts are not linked to any personal identity.

Wallpaper Generator Studio does not store prompts or generated images on its own servers.

Generated wallpapers are stored locally on your device only, unless you choose to delete them.

3. Third-Party Services
OpenAI

Wallpaper Generator Studio uses OpenAI’s image generation API to create wallpapers based on user input.

Prompt data may be processed by OpenAI in accordance with their Privacy Policy.
Wallpaper Generator Studio does not control how OpenAI handles this data and recommends reviewing OpenAI’s Privacy Policy for more information.

Advertising (Google AdMob)

Wallpaper Generator Studio displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob.

Ads may use device-related information for ad delivery, frequency control, and performance measurement.

Personalized ads depend on your system-level privacy and advertising settings.

Google’s data handling practices are governed by Google’s own Privacy Policy.

4. Photos Access

The app does not read, scan, or upload your photo library.

Images are saved only after explicit user action.

If tracking permission is requested, it is used solely to comply with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requirements and advertising regulations.
