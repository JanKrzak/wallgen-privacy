        <p><strong>Wallpaper Generator Studio</strong></p>
        <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Wallpaper Generator Studio respects your privacy.
            This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use
            the Wallpaper Generator Studio mobile application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wallpaper Generator Studio does not require account creation and does
            not collect personal identification information such as your name,
            email address, phone number, or precise location.
        </p>

        <h2>2. User-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>
            Wallpaper Generator Studio allows users to generate custom wallpapers
            by entering text prompts and selecting styles or categories.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Text prompts and selected options are sent to a third-party AI
                service only to generate images requested by the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prompts are not linked to any personal identity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wallpaper Generator Studio does not store prompts or generated
                images on its own servers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Generated wallpapers are stored locally on your device only, unless
            you choose to delete them.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h3>OpenAI</h3>
        <p>
            Wallpaper Generator Studio uses OpenAI’s image generation API to
            create wallpapers based on user input.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prompt data may be processed by OpenAI in accordance with their own
            Privacy Policy. Wallpaper Generator Studio does not control how
            OpenAI handles this data.
        </p>

        <h3>Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
        <p>

            AdMob.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ads may use device-related information for ad delivery,
                frequency control, and performance measurement.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wallpaper Generator Studio does not access or store advertising
                identifiers directly.

            <li>
                Personalized ads depend on your system-level privacy and
                advertising settings.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Photos Access</h2>
        <p>
            Wallpaper Generator Studio requests access to your photo library only
            when you choose to save a generated wallpaper.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The app does not read, scan, or upload your photo library.</li>
            <li>Images are saved only after explicit user action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Tracking & App Tracking Transparency</h2>
        <p>
            Wallpaper Generator Studio does not track users across apps or
            websites owned by other companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            If tracking permission is requested, it is used solely to comply
            with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requirements and
            advertising regulations.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
        <p>
            All generated wallpapers, favorites, and preferences are stored
            locally on your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may remove all stored data at any time by deleting wallpapers
            within the app or uninstalling Wallpaper Generator Studio.
        </p>
